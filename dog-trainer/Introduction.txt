Short Description: This project is made to help dog owners, both new and old,
gain a better understanding of how to better take care of their dog.
This uses a database filled with data of different dog breeds, along
with different programming languages to create a website that shows
information and video links to learn about and train your dog.

Quick Overview of what is created: A homepage that contains a searchbar that
will pull up information of dog breeds, the login page that will sign in the
user, as well as a registration page to add new users. There is also a chat
page in development to allow communication between users.
